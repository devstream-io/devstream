# dtm-repo-scaffolding-golang-gin

This repo contains templates used by DevStream plugin "repo-scaffolding" (thereafter: the plugin).

This repo isn't intended to be used directly without DevStream. It should only be consumed by the plugin automatically.

The plugin (together with this repo of templates) can create a repo in GitHub and set up the project layout and initialize the reop with necessary files that are typical for a Go web app. The followings can be created automatically:

- a Go web app example (source code from [here](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin)) with the [Gin Web Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- directory structure, following [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) best practice
- `.gitignore`, generated by [Toptal | gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/go,vim,macos,visualstudiocode) with minimum changes
- Makefile, with install/dev/build/clean
- Dockerfile, with multistage build
- a simplified Helm chart with Deployment and Service

## Usage

- Render all files using go template whose name end with `.tpl` suffix.
- Files whose name don't end with `.tpl` extension don't need to be rendered.
- subdirectory "helm/**_app_name_**" (the **_app_name_** part) should be rendered with `AppName`
- subdicrectory "cmd/**_app_name_**" (the **_app_name_** part) should be rendered with `AppName`

Example of required parameters to render these templates:

```yaml
AppName: my-hello-world
Repo:
  Owner: ironcore864
  Name: my-hello-world
ImageRepo: ironcore864/my-hello-world # dockerhub
```
