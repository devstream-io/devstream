# dtm-jenkins-pipeline-example

This repo contains templates used by DevStream plugin "jenkins-pipeline" (thereafter: the plugin).

This repo isn't intended to be used directly without DevStream. It should only be consumed by the plugin automatically.

The plugin (together with this repo of templates) can create a Jenkinsfile file in scm.
