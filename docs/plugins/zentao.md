# zentao Plugin

This plugin installs [ZenTao](https://zentao.net/) in an existing Kubernetes cluster by go client.

**Notes:**

- ZenTao will be installed in K8s cluster, please prepare a K8s cluster before using ZenTao plugin.
  For local build, you can use `hack/e2e/e2e-up.sh` to create a K8s cluster via `Kind`.
- Currently, all fields list in the example config file below are required. You can modify them according to your needs.
- This plugin is not supported to run on `arm64` architecture now.

```

## Deployment

### Step1: Prepare a Kubernetes Cluster

- If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, ignore this step. 
- If not, you can use `hack/e2e/e2e-up.sh` to create a K8s cluster via `Kind` as test environment.

```shell
bash hack/e2e/e2e-up.sh
```

### Step2: Create ZenTao Application via Config File

- Create a ZenTao config file following the usage example above.

```shell
./dtm apply -f ZenTao.yaml --debug
```

### Step3: Initialize ZenTao Application

1. Visit `http://NodeIP:NodePort`("NodeIP" and "NodePort" are Kubernets node IP and node port) to start the initialization process. Press `Start Installation` button to the next step.

2. You don't need to do anything about the system check and it's done automatically. If there are system check items that do not pass, please make sure that the previous operation is correct. If it still doesn't work, create an issue to track your problem.

3. Fill in database password filed with `options.deployment.mysqlPasswdValue` which was set previously in `ZenTao.yaml`.

4. If everything proceeds successfully, you will see the Zendo introduction.

5. Fill in your company name and create an administrator account.
