# gitlabci-java Plugin

This plugin set up Gitlab Pipeline in an existing Gitlab Java repository.

## Usage

**Notes:**

1. This plugin requires a Java Gitlab repository first

2. If `Build` is enabled (see the example below), you need to set `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. This will push the new built image to your repository(only support docker hub now).

3. If `Deploy` is enabled, you need to offer the Gitlab Kubernetes agent name(see [Gitlab-Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.cn/jh/user/clusters/agent/) for more details). This will deploy the new built application to your Kubernetes cluster. This step will use `deployment.yaml` to automatically deploy the application. Please create `manifests` directory in the repository root and create your `deployment.yaml` configuration file in it.

The following content is an example of the "tool file".

For more information on the main config, the tool file and the var file of DevStream, see [Core Concepts Overview](../core-concepts/overview.md) and [DevStream Configuration](../core-concepts/config.md).

```yaml
--8<-- "gitlabci-java.yaml"
