# Quick Start

If you haven't watch the demo yet, see it on the [main page](./index.md).

## 1 Download DevStream (`dtm`)

Please visit GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/devstream-io/devstream/releases) page and download the appropriate binary according to your operating system and architecture.

Note : `dtm` currently doesn't support Windows yet.

For Linux/Macos users:

- rename the downloaded binary to `dtm` and move it to your PATH (e.g.: `mv dtm /usr/local/bin/`)
- grant `dtm` executable permission (e.g.: `chmod a+x dtm`)

## 2 Prepare a Config File

Before you start: for an example of DevStream config, see [examples/quickstart.yaml](https://github.com/devstream-io/devstream/blob/main/examples/quickstart.yaml). 
Remember to open this configuration file, modify all FULL_UPPER_CASE_STRINGS (like YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME, for example) in it to your own. Pay attention to the meaning of each item to ensure that it is what you want. For other plugins, checkout the "Plugins" section in our [doc](https://docs.devstream.io) for detailed usage.

Download the [examples/quickstart.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devstream-io/devstream/main/examples/quickstart.yaml) to your working directory:

```shell
curl -o quickstart.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devstream-io/devstream/main/examples/quickstart.yaml
```

Then modify the file accordingly.

For example, my GitHub username is "IronCore864", and my Dockerhub username is "ironcore864", then I can run:

```shell
sed -i.bak "s/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_CASE_SENSITIVE/IronCore864/g" quickstart.yaml

sed -i.bak "s/YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/ironcore864/g" quickstart.yaml
```

> This config file uses two plugins, one will create a GitHub repository and bootstrap it into a Golang web app, and the other will create GitHub Actions workflow for it.

The two plugins, [githubactions-golang](./plugins/githubactions-golang.md) &
[github-repo-scaffolding-golang](./plugins/github-repo-scaffolding-golang.md), require an environment variable to work, so let's set it:

```shell
export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"
```

If you don't know how to create a GitHub token, check out [the official document here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## 3 Initialize

Run:

```shell
dtm init -f quickstart.yaml
```

and you should see similar output to:

```
2022-03-04 12:08:06 ℹ [INFO]  Initialize started.
2022-03-04 12:08:06 ℹ [INFO]  Using dir <.devstream> to store plugins.

2022-03-04 12:08:15 ✔ [SUCCESS]  [github-repo-scaffolding-golang-darwin-arm64_0.2.0.so] download succeeded.

2022-03-04 12:08:20 ✔ [SUCCESS]  Initialize finished.
```

This step verifies the MD5 sum of your dtm binary, downloads the required plugins according to the config file, and verifies the plugins' MD5 sums as well.

Note: if your dtm binary's MD5 sum doesn't match the MD5 sum from our release page, dtm init will stop. If your local dtm MD5 differs, it indicates that you built the binary yourself (for developing purposes, for example). Due to the nature of the Go plugin, dtm must be built together with the corresponding plugins. So, if you are building dtm, you should also build the plugins as well, in which case, you do not need to run dtm init to download the plugins.

## 4 Usage Overview

To apply the config, run:

```shell
./dtm apply -f YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

If you don't specify the config file with the "-f" parameter, it will try to use the default value which is "config.yaml" from the current directory.

_`dtm` will compare the config, the state, and the resources to decide whether a "create", "update", or "delete" is needed. For more information, read our [Core Concepts documentation here](./core-concepts/core-concepts.md)._

The command above will ask you for confirmation before actually executing the changes. To apply without confirmation (like `apt-get -y update`), run:

```shell
./dtm -y apply -f YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

To delete everything defined in the config, run:

```shell
./dtm delete -f YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

_Note that this deletes everything defined in the config. If some config is deleted after apply (state has it but config not), `dtm delete` won't delete it. It differs from `dtm destroy`._

Similarly, to delete without confirmation:

```shell
./dtm -y delete -f YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```
To delete everything defined in the config, regardless of the state:

```shell
./dtm delete --force -f YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

To verify, run:

```shell
./dtm verify -f YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

To destroy everything, run:

```shell
./dtm destroy -f YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

_`dtm` will read the state, then determine which tools are installed, and then remove those tools. It's same as `dtm apply -f empty.yaml` (empty.yaml is an empty config file)._

## 5 Apply

Run:

```shell
dtm apply -f quickstart.yaml
```

and confirm to continue, then you should see similar output to:

## 6 Check the Results

Go to your GitHub account, and we can see a new repo named "go-webapp-devstream-demo" has been created; there are some Golang web app scaffolding lying around already, and the GitHub Actions for building the app is also ready. Hooray!

## 7 Clean Up

Run:

```shell
dtm destroy -f quickstart.yaml
```

and you should see similar output:
