# dtm develop

`dtm develop` is used to develop a new plugin for anything.

## Brief

`dtm develop create-plugin` generates plugin scaffolding based on dtm [pre-built templates](https://github.com/devstream-io/devstream/tree/main/internal/pkg/develop/plugin/template).

`dtm develop validate-plugin` is used for validating an existing plugin or all plugins.

## Full Process Guide

A detailed guide to the plugin development process can be found in [creating-a-plugin](https://docs.devstream.io/en/latest/contributing/creating-a-plugin/).
