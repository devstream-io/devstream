# Contribute

## How Can I Contribute?

Report bugs, create issues, propose new features by creating an issue with the corresponding issue template, and label it accordingly.

If you intend to change the public API or make any non-trivial change, filing an issue first is recommended. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before putting significant effort into it.

If you are only fixing a bug, itâ€™s OK to submit a PR without an issue. In this case, Filing an issue is still recommended because it helps us track the issue.

If you are an enthusiastic contributor but find no suitable issues or bugs for you, adding more tests and improving the quality of the documentation are always welcome!
