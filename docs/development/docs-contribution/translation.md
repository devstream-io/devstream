# Document Translation

The DevStream documentation is usually written in English and then translated to Chinese.
In this article, I am going to talk to you about how to translate an article.
But since the target language is Chinese and the target reader is also a Chinese-speaking reader, I will express it in Chinese. 
Please switch to the Chinese version for more information.
