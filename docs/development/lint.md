# Lint

We use `golangci-lint` ([official website](https://golangci-lint.run/), [GitHub](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)) for linting, which is a Go linters aggregator.

It's also integrated with the GitHub Actions workflows.

- The list of linters enabled by default is documented [here](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/linters/).
- It can be [integrated with IDE](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/integrations/)
- You can [run it locally](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/quick-start/).

Besides, we also use the [Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/devstream-io/devstream).

There is a badge like [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/devstream-io/devstream)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/devstream-io/devstream) in the main README.md.
