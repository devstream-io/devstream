# Contributing

Welcome to DevStream!

Thanks for contributing, and thanks for reading this doc before doing it!

The [DevStream Docs website](https://docs.devstream.io/en/latest/contribute/) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more.

Those guidelines, as the name suggests, are only guidelines, not rules. So, use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to the contribute/development docs.
